# valRosters
<p> This website is designed to track players and player stats from a game call "Valorant"</p>
<p> Once logged in you have the ability to create your own team and add players. These players will be sent to the table everyone has access to but only you have the ability to make changes. Guests (people who arent signed in) can see all the data displayed in a table on in the "Current players" page and (as the wildcard bouns) they can sort it by ascending or descending order!</p>
<p> This website is something I'd like to build-up more and add more features as well as being a bit easier on the eyes(needs a bit more styling haha)</p>

<p> My idea for this project came from this website: </p> <link>https://www.vlr.gg/stats/?event_group_id=all&event_id=all&region=na&country=all&min_rounds=200&min_rating=1550&agent=all&map_id=all&timespan=60d</link>
