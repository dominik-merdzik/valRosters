<p> This website is designed to track players and player stats from a game call "Valorant"</p>
<p> It requires the user (most cases someone like an adminstrator) to input data about the player 
    then, users can see all the data displayed in a table and (as the wildcard bouns) they can sort it by ascending or descending order!</p>
<p> This website is something I'd like to build-up more and add more features as well as being a bit easier on the eyes(needs a bit more styling haha)</p>

<p> My idea for this website came from this website: </p> <link>https://www.vlr.gg/stats/?event_group_id=all&event_id=all&region=na&country=all&min_rounds=200&min_rating=1550&agent=all&map_id=all&timespan=60d</link>
